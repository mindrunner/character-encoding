Character encoding - a fundamental part of software internationalisation

  Software constructed for the global market must be aware of regional
  differences, such as different languages, culture dependent formatting and
  customised user interfaces. Without a character encoding technique, which can
  handle all characters used worldwide, every software needs to add its own
  support for handling different character sets. Since this is a non-trivial
  task, the overhead to globalise and internationalise a software would be a
  huge impact on development time and costs. Therefore, a uniform code that can
  interpret all known characters is needed as the foundation of all
  internationalisation tasks in software development. The current solution,
  Unicode, solves this problem for the most part. Although not all problems were
  resolved by it.
